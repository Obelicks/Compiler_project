|| and | not the same, || handled in the parser.

TYPE NEEDS TO BE CHECKED, THEY ARE TYPES NOT VARIABLES!!!!!!

%prec NAME -> define it in association

in scanner make sure comments gets ignored (* comment *) and # comment
if we cant make || and |exp| work then we make abs() indead of |exp|

this code no works(# Code generation, simple while loop
var i: int;

i = 3;
while i < 3 do {
   write 9;
   i = i + 1;
}
write 2;

while i <= 4 do {
   write i;
   i = i + 1;
}
write 2;
)seems to be writes fault
