%prec NAME -> define it in association


NEEDS TO BE CHECKED:


Alle regler i grammatikken der leder til et "statement" kræver et nyt scope

symbol struct contains void pointer "value" in case we want to expand our types to extend other than integers

strings are not a native part of tiger (sheer khan).


Smøkisering:
- Sæt mellemrum i alt Emul har lavet
- exp.y - match funktioner med argumenter
-


Have done:
- changed dumpSymbolTable to printSymbolTable
- symbolTable is called as the first argument in the functions
- Purged tree.h, removed the unused cases and unused kinds and made so that all cases and kinds have the same name
  - Also updated pretty.c files so they work with the new tree.c files
